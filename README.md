# SteinbockSlim

**⚠️ PROJECT DEPRECATED ⚠️**

This project is no longer functional due to the closure of the Boulderado-Counter service that it relied upon.

## What happened?

SteinbockSlim was designed to track real-time occupancy data from Boulder-Gym Steinbock locations by querying the Boulderado-Counter API. Unfortunately, the Boulderado-Counter service has been permanently closed, making this project unable to function as intended.

## Thank you

We want to express our heartfelt gratitude to:
- Everyone who used SteinbockSlim over the years
- All contributors who helped improve the project
- The Boulder-Gym Steinbock community

This is a sad moment for the project, but we truly appreciate all the support from the community throughout its lifetime.

## Repository Status

This repository will remain available as a historical archive. The code and data serve as a record of the project's functionality and may be useful for educational purposes or as a reference for similar projects.
